# Power-Consumption-Prediction
This project predicts the total power consumption of a city using weather and solar radiation data. A Random Forest Regressor is trained and optimized with GridSearchCV, and the model's performance is evaluated using various regression metrics.

Project Overview

Goal: Predict total power consumption across three city zones

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

ML Model: Random Forest Regressor with hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
